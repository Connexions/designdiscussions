There appears to be a pattern of users trying out the current authoring tools and never completing their work.  The current system also does not provide any feedback to an author when export files (PDF, EPUB, etc.) are generated or when the generation fails. <br />      </p>      <h2>How does it solve these problems?</h2>      <p>        <meta charset="utf-8" />        Authoring Services solves the authoring issues by allowing authors to enter content using an editor similar to editors authors are familiar with, provides feedback on the publishing process and provides a Workspace that has simple organization and sharing.  Improved performance for all of this functionality will make authoring a much smoother, more pleasant experience.</p>      <h2>Release</h2>      <p>Authoring Services will be released in early 2013.</p>    </p>  </body></html>
