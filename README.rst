==================
Design discussions
==================

Please see the HTML updated on
http://readthedocs.org/docs/cnxdesign/en/latest/ after each checkin to
github.

A single simple place to keep the various connexions design
discussions.

These are worthwhile discussions that deserve to be kept, and refered
to and expanded, but Trello is not suited to it, and google docs too
heavy.
