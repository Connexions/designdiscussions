    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>API Discussion</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Reviewed Phil's document</span></p>
    <ul><li>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1BGUhq-0ni2lAqDEGKkd1egOnLHjmgXzsBbX3g9Gu1ZA/edit?pli=1#heading=h.dkyxnc9kxg69</li>
    <li>repository should be responsible for rewriting all of the URLs that reference other modules or other resources (images, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Phil thinks the unpublish repository API should be a subset of the Published content repository API.  Ross and Ed disagreed. The point is to make the best API for each repository, not something generic from the start.  if it is possible and logical for them to be the same, fine, but that should not be a design goal.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Kathi agrees with Phil about the API.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ross is concerned that the Unpublish Repo API will be too heavyweight for its purposes.  There was a discussion about how the unpublished repo should be saving parts of HTML instead of an intire document.  Ed brought that discvussion to a halt because it has already been decided that we are storing the HTML on the file system which means we should be saving the entire document in version 1.0.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Zip vs Multipart</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ross suggested we use multipart messages rather than a zip file.  Kathi brought up the fact that her team had trouble implementing multipart when testing the Sword interface from her OERPub tool.  Zip files are easier to deal with on the command line.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Publishing a module that references another module</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We talked through the problem of a user publishing a module that has links to an unpublished module.  The Published repo will return  an error if this happens. Having the editor do that check and allowing the user to select to publish both modules at once is not a version 1.0 operation.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Api should return some structure that has URLs to published content.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Paul suggested we use UUID which would solve some of the rewrite problem.  We will discuss this further on Wed.</span></p>

    <p class='c4'><span>API - Publishing - Resource Handling - Push/Pull</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <ul><li>API should be separate from under the hood behaviors of REPO</li>

    <p class='c4'><span>Mapping</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>publish is potentially a multi-step, async process</li>
    <li>repo does not edit or even parse content - bits served will be bits provided by editor</li>
    <li>Editor POSTs content-to-be-published to same URL</li>
    <li>includes session key</li>
    <li>provides mapping of referenced contentids</li>
    <li>repo never changes bits, we could include crypto signatures as validation.</li>
    <li>mapping could include ‘pull these bits from this public URL’ as different flag</li>
    <li>resource map is critical: separates repo from editor at the modular component level. It is essentially a dictionary, mapping</li>
    <li>as an archive, the repo only provides the bits-as-deposited. If we want partially-already-processed content, then the webview could provide that as a service - the html w/ the map already applied, as it were.</li>
    <li>the work involved is to parse a map (dictionary) first, and whenever hitting a resource-key in the body content, reflect it through the map to create the actual URL to fetch.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Mapping Alternative</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>feature of signing</li>
    <li>if the POST in step 1 contains a set of relative paths (like '?url=m9003.html&url=m9004.html') then those are looked up in the signed ZIP payload</li>
    <li>otherwise, they are remotely GET'd. Then, the 'signed' zip could be throught of as a webserver *content has to be parsed to be verified</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Key Concepts & Concerns from Team Members:</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>mapping not needed in editor : only need resources mapped to module not to repository id names should be avoided</li>
    <li>editor and REPO are separate components, if  id's are shared then they are coupled and these components are not separate defeating our modular design approach</li>
    <li>local names are no longer needed</li>
    <li>mapping should be done for other Editors.</li>
    <li>core feature for main documents with accessible resources</li>
    <li>minimal should be for archive to store info and send back (file system like storage)</li>
    <li>Currently our repo acts like a web server with relative urls to access resources.Archive isn't an HTML tree.</li>
    <li>Build archive not tied to particular format.REPO only needs to map core docs and associate resources. Mapping be a document. Path to resources stored in archive. HTML documents have associated resources[pre-store resources hangs up Editor and creates a garbage issue] Id's will not conflict. Id's are only used as keys for map unique to document.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Two options: either REPO does little work to look within HTML. A mapping document would be needed to convert resourses with URLs. Other options: remove mapping document and change url's within HTML[editor side]</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>dont have to change original authoring bits with map.</li>
    <li>map shouldn't be part of doc to guarantee bits are that of original author</li>
    <li>WebView REPO/HTML. Cross referencing modules, collections, resources is an issue that needs resolving.</li>
    <li>no link validation at Publish</li>
    <li>don't fetch urls from external sources at publication.</li>
    <li>validation solution: Editor layer should check two things: is this a valid url? local url for local image?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Resources Concepts & Concern Cont.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>publish resources as modules and collections are published</li>
    <li>map isn't convenient for other services/editors - too Connexions specific</li>
    <li>fetch original bits from webview/repo. Browser already knows how to pull resources via URL. *either REPO or Editor needs to rewrite bits of resources. Why not have a short lived draft prior to rewrite. Rewrite must happen.</li>
    <li>all resources do not need to live in REPO should be made publicly, easily accessible.</li>
    <li>REPO has API then implements a services then REPO will have to change the bits.</li>
    <li>Resources and copyrights are not about bits, it is about semantics.</li>
    <li>Store separate metadata for resources and documents. Part of API should be able to send documents and resources. Editor wants low resolutions image. Repo stores highest resolution images. Concerned with pushing all the bits at a time. Example of collection .zip package for API. Go to Physics EPUB as example.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>.zip Payload Case</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>author signs off on unpublished bits by pushing up a .zip file via Editor serverside</li>
    <li>How does Editor rewrite resources from REPO when Author signs off content if bits are not to be rewritten?</li>
    <li>Editor could go to REPO and grab module id - defined API hooks. Or REPO could take .zip file with relative links and publish and replace links.</li>
    <li>Level 1: relative links.</li>
    <li>Level2: walks HTML pulls links and anchor tags. REPO valiates then Editor would get url's pointing to REPO content. When editing Editor pulls HTML with public links to published content and an href of html points to REPO. When resources are changed, resources are not editable they are create a new.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Epub/PDF</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li> Editor is only required to go to Published Repo and grab module id.</li>
    <li>Module id is unique. Broken links should be validated via Editor.</li>
    <li>Image resizing: during PDF/EPUB generation. Services to REPO should validate resource.</li>
    <li>EPUB/PDF - generate these files and cache at module level. Where do you store mapping between sizes? Use public url as key for service. This would simplify the API</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Summary/Homework</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>REPO rewrites URLS.</li>
    <li>Editor uses URLS -> when editing we create new urls for the modifiication of the module or collection.</li>
    <li>Phil:  take small part of EPUB to create sample to explain resource links and id@create would be resoluted for user can create links between modules. Create an example of HTML content linking to diff modules and images and how REPO resolves these. Large collection stress test of parsing links and resources.</li>
    </ul>

    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>client side image storing. The goal was to simplify image upload by sending image bits via html to server</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Homework was to test Phil's editor by dragging and dropping images into editor</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Testing Phil's Editor Feedback:</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Discussion of performance of editor in multiple browsers. Pro's and Con's mentioned.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Ed (tested with Bio Images):</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Chrome - great performance</li>
    <li>Firefox - performance issue - images lock browser until the image is loaded</li>
    <li>Pro's UI friendly, performance issue would remain with other methods particularly with Firefox</li>
    <li>Con's performance issues that are browser specific (Firefox, IE9 doesn't work), replacing image: user has to drop image directly on top of current image,   resize/edit image upon  dragging and dropping, user has no idea why browser is lagging due to the fact the image appears in browser, Firefox widely used browser</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Ross:</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Similiar testing issues in Firefox</span></p>
    <ul><li>not comfortable using this technique with Published Repo</li>
    <li>comfortable using this technique with smaller images with Unpublished Repo</li>
    <li>local system has access to image. What happens if file URIpath) is dropped in and file uploaded asynchronously in background, then swap images. IGNORE COMMENT</li>
    <li>data URI isn't used often and therefore not widely tested or implemented in browsers</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Paul:</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>store information similarly to way we store content of a section.</li>
    <li>image separate url from uri</li>
    <li>html, binary info, request info as needed by editor</li>
    <li>json document has payload of module, doesn't mean payload has be been html module; can be data contract url containing snippet of html of image, exercise, etc.</li>
    <li>could be sam uri with different header</li>
    <li>contract shifted to server to pull each resource</li>
    <li>are these be treated as two difference resources? - Kathi - either way server creates two different resources</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Data Model</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>set of routines would have to be written to retrieve resources then passes back to server. get resource, check fingerprints, put if unchanged; if new or modified post.</li>
    <li>all editor should do is edit and save objects that have been modified or new</li>
    <li>authoring tool receives all updated/new objects - only thing that changes is links in tree (where is this handled)</li>
    <li>server returns UUID for objects when called</li>
    <li>editor handles own internal structure then passes to external structure (document tree)</li>
    <li>UUID would solve innermodule linking by putting in link(internal/external) to UUID's from published/unpublished repos</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <ul><li>text with resources with binary bits with uri's trying to treat page and resources as single document (this causes performance issues)- suggests zipping - would allow to manage resources intrinsically</li>
    <li>different data model for published and unpublished repos</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Phil:</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>converting bits into data URI seems to be the issue in Firefox</li>
    <li>dropping is independent action - performance in Firefox is due to image size</li>
    <li>document should not contain data URI's - server side</li>
    <li>data uri's are only used for newly uploaded images being sent to server vs. image upload piece sends call to retrieve url to resource.</li>
    <li>same user experience can be written with either method.</li>
    <li>simplification advantage not performance advantage creates more overhead - not a separate server call</li>
    <li>attempt was to eliminate that number of dependencies - additional contract has to call cnx.org/image then post to resource url</li>
    <li>contract between multiple languages/system</li>
    <li>disallowing data uri forces use of a more complex editor</li>
    <li>images are never changed - cannot be deleted or edited</li>
    <li>source attribute on image is replace with new url</li>
    <li>no hidden resources. elements must be linked with module</li>
    <li>doc is edited, resource added, url sent to editor in html, at publish time publish repo grabs url and gives resources new id's when saved.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Kathi:</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Supporting IE is important</li>
    <li>Data URI scheme completely separate from document tree</li>
    <li>elements should be edited in existing location - eliminates performance issue</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Conclusion</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Uri scheme approach has been REJECTED</li>
    <li>New url scheme needs to be created for editor</li>
    <li>Data model discussion  - is html the tree or is this different? how do we handle inner module linking? Phil: when published; set of modules are published. Published repo checks for errors(miss modules or resources- which is a set of html files and none are published if there is an error)</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Needs Further Discussion</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>data model - this topic didn't seem clearly defined and differed from member to member</li>
    <li>new url scheme for resources</li>
    <li>how do published/unpublished repos will communication with each other</li>
    <li>inner module linking</li>

    <p class='c0'><span>Phil: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Phil is suggesting we use Data URIs to store images and other files in the HTML.  This would be used in the editor, but possibly not in the Web View.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Pros</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Makes drag and drop a client side operation which would make for a good user experience.</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Cons</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Will impact the performance of the editor</li>
    <li>Prevents caching by the browser which will be another performance hit.</li>
    <li>Does not work well in IE.  IE 9 has some support.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>It is unclear how it will perform with some images like the ones from Biology or Physics.  Phil has a working prototype at http://oerpub.github.com/oerpub.editor/.  The team will test it and report back on Monday.</span></p>

    <p class='c0'><span>Phil: only batch operations allowed in Workspace; to edit an individual part, must use editor.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ed: Maybe, when you mouse over module, collection, etc, display the Roles/Metadata options.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>How do we combine all of the options? Perhaps just list them all?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Import/Export function done at the Workspace. Done by the Add button.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Folders - should have drag and drop. Phil: maybe in v2 or etc, you can drag a module onto a collection, and it can become part of the collection. Could also drag a collection or module into a folder.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Remove links to Metadata annd Roles.  We should have a toolbar with a list of operations.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Add 2 columns</span></p>
    <ul><li>Last modified by</li>
    <li>Last Modified Date</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ed will update the mockup to reflect the changes.</span></p>

    <p class='c4'><span>Web View Frameworks</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>It would be nice to have all WebView strings in one place.  Does any of the frameworks offer this?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>If CNX name is changed to OpenStax, we only need to go to one place to change name.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Internationalization</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We should be building in hooks, but we don't have to implement anything yet (OSF funding).</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We need a way to do automated translation, even if we don't do too much translation.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>For languages we don't support, we can have the author provide the strings.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>From Michael: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/extensions/#i18n-extension</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Discussion about if having Strings in one place is important.  Decided it was not a showstopper.</span></p>

    <p class='c4'><span>Authoring Tools Design</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>The notes below are a discussion of the design located at http://connexions.github.com/designdiscussions/AuthoringServicesDesign.xhtml</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Editing properties</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Popup comes up on the side, so the option of ignoring the list is there.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Limit items in sidebar to items you can select from dropdown or radio buttons</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Any editing happens in the editor itself.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Editing Math</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Kathy would like us to use ASCII math (Siyavula uses it). MathJax should handle it.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Phil shared an editor example: (use Firefox) http://wysiwhat.github.com/Aloha-Editor/src/demo/math/</span></p>
    <ul><li>Do Ctrl+M.</li>
    <li>Enter some math where the cursor is such as: x^2_v</li>
    <li>Math  should be rendered in red box above cursor</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Import popup</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>we want to simplify to one page.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>User does not have to select a file type.  Type is determined by system after upload.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>By allowing people to attempt to import items we do not support, we can see what we need to support in the future.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>NO SITE ERRORS SHOULD BE DISPLAYED TO USER.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ed will update the mockup to remove type selection.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Publishing</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Do not display checklist on publishing page.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Need to show license agreement.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Should validate items that are not complete before allowing publishing</span></p>
    <ul><li>title</li>
    <li>Validate links to cnx content are valid</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>After publishing, user will be taken back to workspace where he or she can view the status of content.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ross's idea: Check for errors before the user tries to publish. Perhaps show errors when user tries to save.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Roles</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We want to eliminate having 2 sections. Should be able to add people, and eliminate existing roles.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>If user adds someone using gmail address, we search for...? With OpenID, we don't see their email, we send them an email, and they must click the link, login, and confirm.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Exisiting users must authenticate.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We need an option to not display author's email on content. Perhaps use OpenStax idea, and have option to email author, but don't display email.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Add Files</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Current mockup - Need to simplify add pages. User should only be taken to one page. Perhaps include a preview.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Any uploaded file must be referred to. We currently have too many authors linking to untouched items.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Updating images: there's a benefit to having an image have a new name- solves caching issue.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We should eliminate uploading files as a separate step from creating a figure or a link</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>The upload should be an option when creating these elements</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Import will allow bulk upload if the items are referenced in a document in the zip.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Phil suggested we look at Data URI for image storage: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_URI_scheme</span></p>
    <ul><li>Phil will prepare something for Wed. meeting</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Metadata</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Click button to display field or dropdown to add another.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Those who care about internationalization didn't really care about language variants.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Keywords</span></p>
    <ul><li>We could use character substitution and have a dictionary, or use a hint, or fins key words. "Did you mean...?"</li>
    <li>Keywords should be required; make anything that is marked as a term a keyword if none are entered.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Summary should be required.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Logging</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Things to log</span></p>
    <ul><li>what they click on toolbar</li>
    <li>saving content</li>
    <li>selecting something from dropdown</li>
    <li>clicking cancel/save</li>
    </ul>

    <p class='c4'><span> Web View Test Review</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Michael reviewed his work on the Web View test</span></p>
    <ul><li>http://docs.cnx.mulich.com/</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Test Examples</span></p>
    <ul><li>static0.cnx.mulich.com -- html5 with jquery</li>
    <li>static1.cnx.mulich.com -- Django with Jinja2</li>
    <li>static2.cnx.mulich.com -- Pyramid with Jinja2</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Pyramid with Jinja2 using Bootstrap</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Gives more options with the addition of TAL from Pyramid</li>
    <li>Also get responsive design from Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Jinja2 info: http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/</li>
    <li>Bootstrap: http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Django with Jinja2</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Good simple choice</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> HTML5 with jQuery</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>templating is simple</li>
    <li>Relies on client side processing for boby rendering</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Best Choice</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Pyramid with Jinja2 using Bootstrap</li>
    <li>Also use jQuery to do AJAX</li>
    <li>Body of content is delivered from server.</li>
    <li>Parts around and behind the content are rendered using AJAX</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Some discussion about using Mustache: http://mustache.github.com/</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Decided that there was no need to do everything client side since the content body, header and footer can be delivered staticly from cache.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Collection view could have continuous scrolling where additional module content is added as the user scrolls down.</span></p>

    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>These are some of the things we need to move forward on CCAP and the Rewrite</span></p>
    <ul><li>A/P - we need a template from Words & Numbers</li>
    <li>We need to figure out how many images we can support.</li>
    <li>PrinceXML needs to be updated before February.</li>
    <li>Editor - Specs, add CNXML elements, wire into plone, log events in editor.</li>
    <li>How do we plan to handle the current tabs?</li>
    <li>How will Node JS fit into the current build?</li>
    <li>Everyone's code needs to be reviewed.</li>
    <li>Logging is important because Daniel wants to know how people are using each of the various features on the site.</li>
    <li>Paul:  http://cdn.frozone.mikadosoftware.com/presentation.html#slide1</li>
    <li>Daniel wants to be able to follow a user through a site, regardless of being logged in or not. Not yet sure if this is possible. Not possible with Google analytics.</li>
    <li>Workspace - We need to write specs.</li>
    <li>Someone needs to do a mock-up. Paul is almost finished.</li>
    <li>WebView - Michael is currently testing 3 frameworks.</li>
    <li>We need an initial design. Again, we need to make features available, but not necessarily displayed constantly.</li>
    <li>Infrastructure - make logging viewable.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>

    <p class='c4'><span>Meeting Options</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>continue with the way things are.</li>
    <li>It's possible to meet less often.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Perhaps twice a week.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Tasks would be assigned.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Meetings could be longer.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We would have to each other accountable to their work.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We need to decide the path of building components as a team. Parts need to work well together.</span></p>

    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Frameworks</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Flask is a one man framework, considered a microframework; maybe we shouldn't use it for a long term because things will get messy.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Majority of pyramid works on app engine, as does Django.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>UUIDs should be unique for each module. Tons of processing - can be done in request, or tell request to capture request, handle request, and complete response cycle by generating UUIDs.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We don't want to return to a user on a publish unless we can guarantee that it will be published.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>If branching and merging is an absolute requirement, the proper metaphor is GitHub, not Google Docs.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Google Docs - here is a new ID at a creation point.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>At minimum, we must provide tools to split one module to create 2. modules.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ross: Expose everything as collections; if the content is split, it becomes a module. If someone else's content is referenced, it can become a collection. If that content is edited, a copy is derived.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>How does this affect our immediate implementation?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>The author tool can't give out IDs that the public repository will serve, unless they communicate. Revamp. If too isolated, then we lose those ease of reuse (unique feature)</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Paul: use single Json document that contains content and subset of existing metadata, and add to subsequent metadata... allows authenticated user to save over the top of the document; a separate index per user will be stored, containing a list of documents the user has rights to, tags, and a location of collections.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We hope to continue using the pop bead model.??</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Google Docs is a good metaphor for writing books that have little interaction.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Paul's link :https://speakerdeck.com/u/kennethreitz/p/flasky-goodness</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>If we give up ancestry trails and plain text, we basically give up the merging and branching option.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>If we're constantly rebasing, shouldn't be a problem.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We don't need to support every little editor change.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Phil: Make everything a section, and depending on the amount of nesting, you end up with chapters and books and etc.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>How does this design affect our existing URLs?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Don't expose "Edit Module" or "Edit Collection".</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Paul: put a parent and child into a module.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Could there be various ways to leave a section?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Collection: and organization of the nodes (smaller than modules) in order. Would always have wrapper around them , not exposed to user.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Smash everything into sections! and store in unpublished repository.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We don't have to expose the sections to the general public; we should always wrap it.</span></p>

    <p class='c4'><span>Structure Review</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>WebView - helps with downloading large versions of transformed content. Not native form of author's content. created by transformation services.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Will provide UI for getting a browser-friendly html format of content. Bookmarking, Lenses, Similar, Search, Browse, etc will go through WebView.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Authoring Services - contains logged in author interfaces ; most likely will be separate site. This is what we want to finish first.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Instead of trying to graft new authoring services onto existing site, perhaps simply include an option to try the "new beta version".  New code doesn't provide enough information to be useful.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Right now, we just want to merge client side javascript editor. We should be able to confine editing to one tab.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Functionality of Current Editor Interface</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <ul><li>Edit - Import and Export</li>
    <li>Files - Import and Export (again) . For managing extraneous resources for the module.</li>
    <li>Links - Provides a way to access content to make a distinct association without putting a link inside the content. Also links between content. Basically builds mapping between content.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Do we need a way to link to content that is not a collection? Not immediately.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Type and Strength dropdown - unique feature.</span></p>
    <ul><li>Preview - place to view content before it is published.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Perhaps we should have a PDF preview for the chapter to avoid having to view the entire book. Chapter is usually set of modules.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Vision for Preview feature : We can wrap the module in a single module collection. Even just a small bit of content would appear as a collection.</span></p>
    <ul><li>Publish- agreed with licence, push content out to other tool.</li>
    <li>Metadata - what is metadata, what isn't?</li>
    <li>Roles - metadata regarding permissions, separate from ACL , although related.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>We need to store a list of people who can edit with the content.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Metadata regarding ACL should be able to be modified without changing the version number.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Publishing would require interaction with repository to give authoring permission.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Publish new version and Editor in Authoring Tool are 2 separate permissions.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Paul's prototype should hopefully be ready for the 17th.</span></p>

    <p class='c0'><span>Saving a document - if you have permissions, you are making changes on that same URL. If not, you have derived a copy and are saving at a different URL.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>There is no need to derive a copy if one has permissions.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Version number is not a part of the URL.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Folder copy should not be a part of the URL- complicated. It's just an organizational system.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Folder is unique to the person; the document is one copy.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Workspace should not be in the URL either; it comes with one being logged in.</span></p>

    <p class='c0'><span>Paul's rough draft:</span></p>
    <ul><li>http://frozone.readthedocs.org/en/latest/requirements.html#draft-rest-defintions</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>Metadata will be stored in a microdata format in the html. See June 26 notes</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Collxml will be stored similarly. Also see June 26 notes.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Perhaps we can create a button for the metadata editor. Phil is currently working on one.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>If Editor is stand alone, Html will be stored...?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Editor will be stand-alone: put Javascript file in, configure, editor is there, and work is saved when one presses save. Needs no other parts to be configured.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Editor, workspace, and repository should not be tied together.  The editing of Metadata, Roles, etc. complicates this.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Our main goal - create an editor that can be embedded into any site.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>To have  stand-alone Editor, we need to have Workspace API to perform workflow tasks.  This coule be a lot of work.  Is it worth it?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Ed will create a draft of Editor, Workspace and Unpublished Repository specs before next meeting on Thursday.</span></p>

    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>He starts on July 9th.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>He could work on</span></p>
    <ul><li>Plone Integration with the editor.  This is a good option if Ross has not completed it by July 9.</li>
    <li>Testing Web frameworks for Web View.  These would include Pyramid, Django and Straight JQuery and HTML.</li>
    <li>We will decide as we get closer to July 9.</li>

    <p class='c4'><span>Development Queue</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Sprint 3 - this ends on July 9.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Queue Fix - This covers a couple of changes to the Queue Tool for PDF, EPUB generation.  They include moving the Queue to a separate server and modifying the transactions so that they are shorter.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>PDF space - The PDF database which stores PDFs, EPUBs, ZIPs, etc. has gotten so large that it will not pack on the production database server.  The fix involves moving all of the file storage to the server harddrive and removing the PDF ZODB file.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Chuck PDF fix-dependent on OpenStax College treatment. This is dependent on the OSC PDF fix.  They need to be rolled out together.  Phil should code the OSC fix this week.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span> Items that need to be Developed</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Facebook Like button - Facebook has changed something and the button is no longer working</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Google + button - Google has warned us that they are making changes so we need to do likewise so the button continues to work.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>MathJax 2 upgrade - This will improve math support in IE.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>License page in iframe.  Needs to happen before end of GSoC</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Nagios tweak.  Make sure monitoring notifies us before things break.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>After the things in the development queue, our priority should be Facebook/Google+ buttons, License page and then MathJax upgrade.  The Nagios Tweaks will be an ongoing thing.</span></p>

    <p class='c4'><span> Authoring Repository Decision</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Probably won't have more than 100 people on it at once.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>What we need to save in the repository:</span></p
    <ul><li>module html</li>
    <li>module metadata - includes author roles</li>
    <li>collection html</li>
    <li>collection metadata - includes author roles</li>
    <li>workspace</li>
    <li>access permissions</li>
    <li>media</li>

    <p class='c4'><span>Intro</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We need to make a checklist of functioning elements to give us a record of progress, and flesh out reqgit puluirements.  Ed will create these and add them to the design documentation repository in Github.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Editor</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>What is happening with the public repository implementations (repository being coded by Google)?</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Early demo: http://light-demo.appspot.com.  It does not do much and has no CNX content.  Google is still working on it, but we have not had an update in about a month.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Our plan: map API to Appcale so we have an alternative if the data issue is not resolved.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We want to be able to edit in our editor and publish it to the published repository.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Workgroups</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We want a setup similar to Google Docs:</span></p>
    <ul><li>modules will be listed similar to documents</li>
    <li>Folders will be used to represent Workgroups</li>
    <li>Will be able to Share documents and folders with other users</li>
    <li>Permissions need to be simplifed if possible.</li>
    </ul><p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Current Plan</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We're currently working on Authoring Tool:</span></p>
    <ul><li>Editor - tinyMCE</li>
    <li>Repository</li>
    <li>Logging</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>We need to finish</span></p>
    <ul><li>workspace</li>
    <li>roles</li>
    <li>publishing</li>
    <li>import</li>
    </ul>
    <p class='c0'><span>The Edtior will be added to Plone once it has enough functionality.  The Editor and the new logging will be added.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We want to be able to track the logging and view how people are using the components.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>How does the editor communicate with editor repository (when we press save)? - tinyMCE saves entire file via API.</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c4'><span>Options for Editor After Phase 1</span></p>
    <p class='c1 c0'><span class='c4'></span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>The collaborative model will be stored in the repository.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Comments should be done with a third party tool, as long as they're stored with ids.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We want to be able to see what has been done since last visit to document.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We need to decide whether we're using Source Control (something like Git) or not.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Is it better to attach all the extra components to the document, or simply use workflow? Hooking things to document complicates things.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Source Control doesn't find structural differences.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Minimum change for now: when editor modifies, don't overwrite; create another version.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Track changes is infinitely messier than a diff tool; we want to use a better version of diff tool.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We want to be able to indicate where changes where made,where text was inserted or deleted.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>We will build in the saving of the versions (we're not building an archive, however); show changes of the session, not for each individual change.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>Initially, we can save html. Then eliminate lots of the scope creep.</span></p>
    <p class='c0'><span>If we want to be able to see or edit a doc that is already being edited at the moment, we will need something along the lines of what Flatworld Knowledge (essentially a sort of Track Changes)</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span>Drag and Drop feature issue: TinyMCE is not passing on
        mouse event to jquery. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>TinyMCE may need to be customized beyond writing new plugins.  If we need to customize the tinyMCE code itself, we need to try and do it in a way that is maintainable and updatable.  This could be difficult in JavaScript.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Drag and Drop feature is found in other editors for blockish contents; i.e
        moving slides, images, etc. We want to have it in tinyMCE to keep the user from pasting which adds complexity.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Possible suggestion - use a tree view of the document; able to drag and
        drop title and label to different sections.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We need to decided on one editor. One that is similarly
        licensed to our current editor to ensure that it is usable with out other code. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We also need to fix copy and paste feature.  Even if we code the drag and drop. Users will use copy and paste. It's what
        they know from other editors. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0">We don't want to lose bullets, bold, or italics when the user does copy and paste. We
      may lose sections. Things lost should be lost completely and not
      partially.</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Cross site scripting issue</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    </p>Browser is not responding to 200
      response it's receiving or returning incorrect response. Possibly because
      different domains are being used. Should be addressed in a different
      Sprint. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">This needs to be sorted out because we will want the option of subdomains in the future.</p>

    <p class="c0">No bidding or estimating necessary on Phil's cards.</p>
    <p class="c0">Paul's Card: Implement an OpenID consumer within the flask app
      allowing any openID server to authenticate a user 
      to the unpub repo</p>
    <p class="c0">Estimate: 5. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">This is just the web server asking who user is, then giving
      appropriate login.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Updating the repo will go into a message queue. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Editor will know that changes are saved : Ajax will pick up
      and post.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Paul: Implement a robust message queue for all REST changes
      that will
      affect unpub repo; Migrate repo functions to become 'listeners' on message
      queue</p>
    <p class="c0">Do we actually need a message queue today?</p>
    <p class="c0">Yes eventually, solves storing issues, and testing repo.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Only publishing will be in parallel.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Implement, but don't use if part of Plone. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">What kind of guarantee do we want so that when user saves, it
      actually saves?</p>
    <p class="c0">Advantages of messaging queue - robust, no code necessary, all
      questions answered. Can be turned off.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">UseCase and Architecture should be addressed before message
      queue.</p>
    <p class="c0">Message queue = Sprint 4. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Authentication service: is it time to populate with existing
      users?</p>
    <p class="c0">We don't necessarily need an OpenID client/server as well as
      OAuth client/server.</p>
    <p class="c0">Need client side and authorization to be completed
      first.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Paul's Card: Implement an OpenID server 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Estimate #: 13.</p>
    <p class="c0">EIP: takes too much time to save. No safe way to fix without
      messaging queue. could be faster. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">TinyMCE: there will not be much validation. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Save as html because that's what was written. Only go to CNXML
      if switching editors. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Should have outsiders test new editing before release to
      ensure significant improvement.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">New repo needs to be much faster. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">New editor will be faster: Asynchronous. Saving will take
      longer, but editing will be allowed faster. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Only integrating new editor with Plone; not the remainder of
      the authoring tool. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Able to log what people are doing in the editor to have a
      better idea of what users are doing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Adding new javascript editor that will work with Plone
      authoring tool.

    <p class="c4"><span>Articles</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Ed does not agree with everything in the articles he shares with the team.  They usually contain something interesting that we might want to discuss.   An example is the JavaScript article:
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>http://blogs.adobe.com/bparadie/2012/05/07/the-pew-pew-manifesto/</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>What was interesting was
    <ul>
        <li>Java Script - he called it the assembly language of the browser.</li>
        <li>If you can abstract away from Javascript it can
        reap benefits.</li>
    </ul>
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>What we need to be careful about is reinventing the wheel.  Don't write things in something like CoffeeScript if it is just as easy to use JQuery for the same thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Phil brought up the fact that he is using CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org/) for the editor.  CoffeeScript is a language that is compiled into JavaScript.  This lead to a discussion about introducing new technologies.

    <p class="c0"><span>It was suggested that Code Reviews can be used to keep an eye on new technologies being added to the project.  Code review is very important.  CoffeeScript is not statically typed, so
        everything must be named clearly.

    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">How to handle code reviews</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Send comments by email rather than using github tools?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We want code review, but we don't want to grill each
        other. Do we need to broadcast mistakes on Github. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>It's possible to fix things on github and comment
        privately, but doesn't help the learning process.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Having multiple people view your code can be very
        beneficial. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Ex: somebody is working on a branch for a sprint, they
        check each other. Use the branch RSS feed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Don't want outsiders putting bad comments on code, and
        etc. Intimidation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Delicate comments can be emailed. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Most comments can stay on the public record.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span>Sprint</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Tomorrow: Sprint 3. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Dedicate extra time to planning meeting to get cards
        defined and times estimated. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span><b>Document Decisions</b></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Need to document design official decisions.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Probably will be put in github. Similar to project page.
        Link to design meetings and official desicions. 
      </span></p>

      </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Monitoring</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Example: space issue. Need to monitor in advance so we
        can know how to react</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Fountain:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Monett: has signaling limitations. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Nagios: used by CNX, currently adequate. perhaps in
        need of refreshing. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>CNX also using Munin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Can continue to use Nagios and Munin.  Should be able to monitor in graphite to view trend over time.

    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Tablet Web View 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">Should be the same as web-view, ideally.</p>
    <p class="c0">"Hidden" features - not hidden, but must be clicked to be
      viewed. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Left: table of contents, lenses portlet, recently viewed,
      tags
      <b><span></span></b></p>
    <p class="c0">Table of Contents should be hidden. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Perhaps as a default, hide table of contents, and have an
      option to always display table of contents. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Is it necessary to have a separate page for the table of
      contents, or just go to the first page of the collection?</p>
    <p class="c0">Make table of contents discoverable rather than hidden.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">If we go straight to the first module, you can't tweet the
      collection. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Most users view the content as a holistic book, thus tweet
      about the collection rather than module. </p>
    <p class="c0"></p>
    <p class="c0">Top and bottom social buttons = redundant. We should choose
      one. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">If a user likes a content halfway through, he or she will
      want the social buttons right on the screen instead of having to scroll
      somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Metadata/Reuse and Cite: 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">Lenses: perhaps make a popup or a button. Doesn't need to be
      displayed unless clicked. http://cnx.org/lenses 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Perhaps a button that incorporates all popups: Lenses,
      portlets, tags. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Don't want layered popups. Lenses logos will take up too much
      space. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Images: use a Facebook approach: when an image is uploaded, 4
      sizes are created. 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Recently Viewed</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">Perhaps design in a fashion similar to
      Amazon: Other users viewed this...</p>
    <p class="c0">When you first look on a module, should have the display of
      all content features , but a one click button hides everything so the user
      can just read and view the content.
    </p>
    <p class="c0">How important is Recently Viewed? Should we redo or remove?</p>
    <p class="c0">Hover text.</p>
    <p class="c0">We need to decide to use either text or icons, but not both.
    </p>
    <p class="c0">for example, Google: very short, concise text at the top of
      the screen in the black bar. 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Collection Web View Summary:&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">1. No Collection page. Go straight to the first module.</p>
    <p class="c0">2. Table of Contents with hideable option.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">3. When in collection context, social buttons point to
      collection.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">4. Collection metadata- popup that has twisties for separate
      sections. popup triggered from collection context header.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">5. Related material button: combine lenses and tags portlets,
      display both module and collection info.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">6. Move Recently Viewed to search/browse; do not display while
      viewing content. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">7. Apply #6 to Similar Content.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">8. Eliminate text by top level content action buttons; be
      consistent with text or icons for actions within a given context. See Google Docs when a document is open.

    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>can we have a link to TOC at the bottom? Another option is adding link right under the authors.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Title, blue CNX bar, module, authors, content, glossary at the bottom</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Next and Previous options should be seen.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Is the browse option necessary? No one uses it.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We should remove the View Lenses option.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Search will be supplied from Google.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>ask Ross about access logs on m.cnx.org.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span>How helpful are the tabs? Frequently do not work.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We can remove About Us page, perhaps.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Are Lenses and Browse useful on a smart phone?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We should make site more "smart-phone-esque". It should look like an app rather than a webpage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Most people are not finding content by browsing. Using a large search bar would be more efficient.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Books do not have unique covers - people get confused. All collections look the same.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>If authors were allowed to choose a random image from their module or collection as the cover. If not, icons will be assigned.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Phase 2 suggestion: Cover Creator.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Need to make table of contents more readily available (slide out or pop out). That way we can be able to use more ajax and javascript.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Must be able to scroll.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Look into Bootstrap. http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Tablet View</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Should be very close to the full site.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Little to no changes should be made.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Master/Slave option: chapter TOC on one side, module on the other when in landscape.</span></p>  
    <p class="c0"><span>don't display table of contents. Perhaps use a button.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We want content to main display of the page.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Recently Viewed, Similar content,</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Perhaps we should change to "most people who looked at .... also looked at"</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Is similarity still viable? How accurate?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Current algorithm- performance issue (sometimes completely wrong), inefficient. Accuracy issue.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Search engine will use html from tablet, so we need enough links in html so that site is seen as optimally interconnected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Google is capable of indexing the ajax.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>If Google indexed entire site, it wouldn't matter if Recently Viewed was retrieved.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Web View</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Have been planning to use Pyramid, which comes with TAL. Marvin thinks Django might be a better way to go -- more support, google app engine. Big sites running Django -- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/ big websites run by Django: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1907034/756056</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">What is in the webview?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to a random collection to see what is there. - http://cnx.org/content/randomContent?portal_type=Collection</li>
        <li>Metadata, content, table of contents, actions (reuse, download etc.), lenses, lens branding, related material (out of date), social networking, order printing, links to the versions, reuse and attribution page, search features, header/branding</li>
        <li>Layout needs to be simplified for the average reader -- too complex. Want to have all the functionality, but somehow layered in a way that is much easier for basic users to use.</li>
        <li>Also note that people use the content in different ways</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading a single module on a single topic found through web search</li>
          <li>Reading a whole textbook online, in pdf or epub for a class you are taking or teaching</li>
          <li>Using a homework system that directs you to individual modules as it determines prerequisites you might need.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul
    </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Might want to consider architecting the webview so that it can eventually be coordinated better with the epub and pdf versions -- same numbering and similar styling. Teachers and learners always ask for this and struggle with how different they are. Phil provided some notes about such which is included at the bottom of the post.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Web templates and policies:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Want to come up with a set of policies and review processes for the web templates do we want:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      <ul>
        <li>No business logic in the templates. Just display logic. The logic should be in methods on the objects.</li>
        <li>May want to control the libraries that are used so that it doesn’t end up with a</li>
        <li>Enforce with code reviews. Maybe some lint-like tool for some rules that can help expedite the code review.</li>
        <li>Can have a checklist that can be used by programmers and by reviewers.</li>
        <li>Phil - Would it be useful to have the same templating language server and client side? Ross: TAL has javascript client and server side.</li>
      </ul>
    </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Phil’s notes about making the formats more congruent: Same CSS for Different Formats</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>When collection context is known we could inject "counter-reset: chapter 3, section 2, exercise 12, custom-exercise: 45" so numbering is correct.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>https://github.com/philschatz/oer.epubcss allows CSS "features" to be "baked into" formats that don't normally support them. For example: epub1 doesn't support counters (for numbering sections/exercises), Some browsers don't support collating elements (move-to).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The CNXML to HTML doc has some notes in it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E2RGJf0kHdgWOd2590VGmv9YixgmDFo-gX3xlbLGgM0/edit?pli=1</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Some editing/authoring stuff that came up in the conversation</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      <ul>
        <li>When editing modules -- make sure they are easy to break apart into a series of modules.</li>
        <li>Make it possible to add search results to a collection. This idea came up twice! (CNX currently lets you add search results to a work area if you are logged in.) </li>

    <p class="c0"><span>-At Chase, url didn&rsquo;t contain code path. </span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span>-storing salt with the password=not wise. Will however, prevent rainbow attack.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-If password hashed with user = system salt stored with user salt. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Must use strong algorithm. If one can attack database, can attack salt. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Standard - keep salt next to hash.</span></p>
