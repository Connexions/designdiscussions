    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Drag and Drop feature issue: TinyMCE is not passing on
        mouse event to jquery. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>TinyMCE may need to be customized beyond writing new plugins.  If we need to customize the tinyMCE code itself, we need to try and do it in a way that is maintainable and updatable.  This could be difficult in JavaScript.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Drag and Drop feature is found in other editors for blockish contents; i.e
        moving slides, images, etc. We want to have it in tinyMCE to keep the user from pasting which adds complexity.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Possible suggestion - use a tree view of the document; able to drag and
        drop title and label to different sections.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We need to decided on one editor. One that is similarly
        licensed to our current editor to ensure that it is usable with out other code. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We also need to fix copy and paste feature.  Even if we code the drag and drop. Users will use copy and paste. It's what
        they know from other editors. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0">We don't want to lose bullets, bold, or italics when the user does copy and paste. We
      may lose sections. Things lost should be lost completely and not
      partially.</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Cross site scripting issue</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    </p>Browser is not responding to 200
      response it's receiving or returning incorrect response. Possibly because
      different domains are being used. Should be addressed in a different
      Sprint. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">This needs to be sorted out because we will want the option of subdomains in the future.</p>

    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">Sprint Dates: June 20th- July 9th</p>
    <p class="c0">Architecture: diagrams will be made explaining all moving
      parts.
    </p>
    <p class="c0">No bidding or estimating necessary on Phil's cards.</p>
    <p class="c0">Paul's Card: Implement an OpenID consumer within the flask app
      allowing any openID server to authenticate a user 
      to the unpub repo</p>
    <p class="c0">Estimate: 5. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">This is just the web server asking who user is, then giving
      appropriate login.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Updating the repo will go into a message queue. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Editor will know that changes are saved : Ajax will pick up
      and post.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Paul: Implement a robust message queue for all REST changes
      that will
      affect unpub repo; Migrate repo functions to become 'listeners' on message
      queue</p>
    <p class="c0">Do we actually need a message queue today?</p>
    <p class="c0">Yes eventually, solves storing issues, and testing repo.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Only publishing will be in parallel.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Implement, but don't use if part of Plone. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">What kind of guarantee do we want so that when user saves, it
      actually saves?</p>
    <p class="c0">Advantages of messaging queue - robust, no code necessary, all
      questions answered. Can be turned off.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">UseCase and Architecture should be addressed before message
      queue.</p>
    <p class="c0">Message queue = Sprint 4. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Authentication service: is it time to populate with existing
      users?</p>
    <p class="c0">We don't necessarily need an OpenID client/server as well as
      OAuth client/server.</p>
    <p class="c0">Need client side and authorization to be completed
      first.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Paul's Card: Implement an OpenID server 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Estimate #: 13.</p>
    <p class="c0">EIP: takes too much time to save. No safe way to fix without
      messaging queue. could be faster. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">TinyMCE: there will not be much validation. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Save as html because that's what was written. Only go to CNXML
      if switching editors. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Should have outsiders test new editing before release to
      ensure significant improvement.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">New repo needs to be much faster. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">New editor will be faster: Asynchronous. Saving will take
      longer, but editing will be allowed faster. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Only integrating new editor with Plone; not the remainder of
      the authoring tool. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Able to log what people are doing in the editor to have a
      better idea of what users are doing.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">Adding new javascript editor that will work with Plone
      authoring tool. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Rhaptos module editor is the unpublished repository in Plone.</p>

    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span>Articles</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Ed does not agree with everything in the articles he shares with the team.  They usually contain something interesting that we might want to discuss.   An example is the JavaScript article:
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>http://blogs.adobe.com/bparadie/2012/05/07/the-pew-pew-manifesto/</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>What was interesting was
    <ul>
        <li>Java Script - he called it the assembly language of the browser.</li>
        <li>If you can abstract away from Javascript it can
        reap benefits.</li>
    </ul>
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>What we need to be careful about is reinventing the wheel.  Don't write things in something like CoffeeScript if it is just as easy to use JQuery for the same thing.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Phil brought up the fact that he is using CoffeeScript (http://coffeescript.org/) for the editor.  CoffeeScript is a language that is compiled into JavaScript.  This lead to a discussion about introducing new technologies.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Introducing New Technologies to Project</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Discuss technology as a group before choosing one, so 
        everyone can be aware of which tools are being used, and why it is being
        used.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>It was suggested that Code Reviews can be used to keep an eye on new technologies being added to the project.  Code review is very important.  CoffeeScript is not statically typed, so
        everything must be named clearly. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">How to handle code reviews</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Send comments by email rather than using github tools?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We want code review, but we don't want to grill each
        other. Do we need to broadcast mistakes on Github. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>It's possible to fix things on github and comment
        privately, but doesn't help the learning process.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Having multiple people view your code can be very
        beneficial. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Ex: somebody is working on a branch for a sprint, they
        check each other. Use the branch RSS feed.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Don't want outsiders putting bad comments on code, and
        etc. Intimidation.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Delicate comments can be emailed. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Most comments can stay on the public record.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span>Sprint</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Tomorrow: Sprint 3. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Dedicate extra time to planning meeting to get cards
        defined and times estimated. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      </span></p>
    <p class="c4"><span><b>Document Decisions</b></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Need to document design official decisions.
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Probably will be put in github. Similar to project page.
        Link to design meetings and official desicions. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Monitoring</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Example: space issue. Need to monitor in advance so we
        can know how to react</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Fountain:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Monett: has signaling limitations. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Nagios: used by CNX, currently adequate. perhaps in
        need of refreshing. 
      </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>CNX also using Munin.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Can continue to use Nagios and Munin.  Should be able to monitor in graphite to view trend over time. 
      </span></p>

    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Tablet Web View 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">Should be the same as web-view, ideally.</p>
    <p class="c0">"Hidden" features - not hidden, but must be clicked to be
      viewed. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Left: table of contents, lenses portlet, recently viewed,
      tags
      <b><span></span></b></p>
    <p class="c0">Table of Contents should be hidden. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Perhaps as a default, hide table of contents, and have an
      option to always display table of contents. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Is it necessary to have a separate page for the table of
      contents, or just go to the first page of the collection?</p>
    <p class="c0">Make table of contents discoverable rather than hidden.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">If we go straight to the first module, you can't tweet the
      collection. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Most users view the content as a holistic book, thus tweet
      about the collection rather than module. </p>
    <p class="c0"></p>
    <p class="c0">Top and bottom social buttons = redundant. We should choose
      one. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">If a user likes a content halfway through, he or she will
      want the social buttons right on the screen instead of having to scroll
      somewhere.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Metadata/Reuse and Cite: 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">Lenses: perhaps make a popup or a button. Doesn't need to be
      displayed unless clicked. http://cnx.org/lenses 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Perhaps a button that incorporates all popups: Lenses,
      portlets, tags. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Don't want layered popups. Lenses logos will take up too much
      space. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">Images: use a Facebook approach: when an image is uploaded, 4
      sizes are created. 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Recently Viewed</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">Perhaps design in a fashion similar to
      Amazon: Other users viewed this...</p>
    <p class="c0">When you first look on a module, should have the display of
      all content features , but a one click button hides everything so the user
      can just read and view the content.
    </p>
    <p class="c0">How important is Recently Viewed? Should we redo or remove?</p>
    <p class="c0">Hover text.</p>
    <p class="c0">We need to decide to use either text or icons, but not both.
    </p>
    <p class="c0">for example, Google: very short, concise text at the top of
      the screen in the black bar. 
    </p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c4">Collection Web View Summary:&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0">1. No Collection page. Go straight to the first module.</p>
    <p class="c0">2. Table of Contents with hideable option.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">3. When in collection context, social buttons point to
      collection.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">4. Collection metadata- popup that has twisties for separate
      sections. popup triggered from collection context header.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">5. Related material button: combine lenses and tags portlets,
      display both module and collection info.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">6. Move Recently Viewed to search/browse; do not display while
      viewing content. 
    </p>
    <p class="c0">7. Apply #6 to Similar Content.&nbsp;</p>
    <p class="c0">8. Eliminate text by top level content action buttons; be
      consistent with text or icons for actions within a given context. See Google Docs when a document is open.

    <p class="c0"><span>We can remove About Us page, perhaps.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Are Lenses and Browse useful on a smart phone?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We should make site more "smart-phone-esque". It should look like an app rather than a webpage.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Most people are not finding content by browsing. Using a large search bar would be more efficient.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Books do not have unique covers - people get confused. All collections look the same.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>If authors were allowed to choose a random image from their module or collection as the cover. If not, icons will be assigned.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Phase 2 suggestion: Cover Creator.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Need to make table of contents more readily available (slide out or pop out). That way we can be able to use more ajax and javascript.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Must be able to scroll.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Look into Bootstrap. http://twitter.github.com/bootstrap/</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Tablet View</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Should be very close to the full site.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Little to no changes should be made.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Master/Slave option: chapter TOC on one side, module on the other when in landscape.</span></p>  
    <p class="c0"><span>don't display table of contents. Perhaps use a button.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>We want content to main display of the page.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Recently Viewed, Similar content,</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Perhaps we should change to "most people who looked at .... also looked at"</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Is similarity still viable? How accurate?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Current algorithm- performance issue (sometimes completely wrong), inefficient. Accuracy issue.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Search engine will use html from tablet, so we need enough links in html so that site is seen as optimally interconnected.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Google is capable of indexing the ajax.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>If Google indexed entire site, it wouldn't matter if Recently Viewed was retrieved.</span></p>

    <p class="c0"><span>Have been planning to use Pyramid, which comes with TAL. Marvin thinks Django might be a better way to go -- more support, google app engine. Big sites running Django -- https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/dev/topics/templates/ big websites run by Django: http://stackoverflow.com/a/1907034/756056</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">What is in the webview?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      <ul>
        <li>Go to a random collection to see what is there. - http://cnx.org/content/randomContent?portal_type=Collection</li>
        <li>Metadata, content, table of contents, actions (reuse, download etc.), lenses, lens branding, related material (out of date), social networking, order printing, links to the versions, reuse and attribution page, search features, header/branding</li>
        <li>Layout needs to be simplified for the average reader -- too complex. Want to have all the functionality, but somehow layered in a way that is much easier for basic users to use.</li>
        <li>Also note that people use the content in different ways</li>
        <ul>
          <li>Reading a single module on a single topic found through web search</li>
          <li>Reading a whole textbook online, in pdf or epub for a class you are taking or teaching</li>
          <li>Using a homework system that directs you to individual modules as it determines prerequisites you might need.</li>
        </ul>
      </ul
    </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Might want to consider architecting the webview so that it can eventually be coordinated better with the epub and pdf versions -- same numbering and similar styling. Teachers and learners always ask for this and struggle with how different they are. Phil provided some notes about such which is included at the bottom of the post.</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Web templates and policies:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>Want to come up with a set of policies and review processes for the web templates do we want:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      <ul>
        <li>No business logic in the templates. Just display logic. The logic should be in methods on the objects.</li>
        <li>May want to control the libraries that are used so that it doesn’t end up with a</li>
        <li>Enforce with code reviews. Maybe some lint-like tool for some rules that can help expedite the code review.</li>
        <li>Can have a checklist that can be used by programmers and by reviewers.</li>
        <li>Phil - Would it be useful to have the same templating language server and client side? Ross: TAL has javascript client and server side.</li>
      </ul>
    </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Phil’s notes about making the formats more congruent: Same CSS for Different Formats</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>When collection context is known we could inject "counter-reset: chapter 3, section 2, exercise 12, custom-exercise: 45" so numbering is correct.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>https://github.com/philschatz/oer.epubcss allows CSS "features" to be "baked into" formats that don't normally support them. For example: epub1 doesn't support counters (for numbering sections/exercises), Some browsers don't support collating elements (move-to).</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>The CNXML to HTML doc has some notes in it: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1E2RGJf0kHdgWOd2590VGmv9YixgmDFo-gX3xlbLGgM0/edit?pli=1</span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Some editing/authoring stuff that came up in the conversation</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>
      <ul>
        <li>When editing modules -- make sure they are easy to break apart into a series of modules.</li>
        <li>Make it possible to add search results to a collection. This idea came up twice! (CNX currently lets you add search results to a work area if you are logged in.) </li>
      </ul>

    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">User Security (from Article)</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Open ID people</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-force a password change on users</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>- currently, passwords stored in Plone in hash. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>- old users will have option of keeping or changing password. Encouraged to change. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>- knowing that encrypted with Sscrypt is not a problem.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Use countdown. &ldquo;Change password in the next X days&rdquo;.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-eternal nag - encouraged to change password every time one logs in. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Users:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. use existing Plone hash (after examination)</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. Run through scrypt with 128 bit salt</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-all passwords handled through the same path, just with different origins</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-use same code whether accessing through Plone or open ID user. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-same module from same code base; different paths</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-1 code base on 1 server because on Open ID.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>- Extra amount of time, with some users using hash 1 and some using hash 2. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-If not all users change passwords, there will be a small delay. &nbsp;</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Slow transition from scrypt/hash to scrypt/plaintext. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Incorrect Login</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-currently, when password is incorrect, we return id and no password. We shouldn&rsquo;t return any information.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-If we open up as Open ID repository, we need to be as secure as possible. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-At Chase, url didn&rsquo;t contain code path. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-attacker would have url that exposes code path.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-need to verify origin of request. If session ID isn&rsquo;t in database, request dropped. Prevents Man in the Middle attack. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Nothing is passed as unencrypted parameter. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-SSH and strongly encrypted, no hints if fail would be better than current setup. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Blog: store salt per hash per user. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Login Page:</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1. use SSH</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2. If a failure, do not expose correct ID. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-storing salt with the password=not wise. Will however, prevent rainbow attack.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-If password hashed with user = system salt stored with user salt. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Must use strong algorithm. If one can attack database, can attack salt. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Standard - keep salt next to hash.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Storing salt next to hash prevents attack against all, but not against one individual. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Security groups. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Does not matter where salt is stored. Salt for every user = protected. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-Store a salt for each hash, but not in a separate location. </span></p>
    <p class="c1 c0"><span class="c4"></span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span class="c4">Web View</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-need to discuss Pyramid/ TAL.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-allowed to write Python expressions.</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-difference between Web View and everything else?</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-want Web View to display only</span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-logic can be in any random template because of TAL. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-html stored (editable version) not the same as html rendered to the browser. </span></p>
    <p class="c0"><span>-need a strict policy regarding template allowances. </span></p>
