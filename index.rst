Design Discussions
==================

During conversations with Dak, I found it useful to have a central
location for ... well ... specs, discussion documents, things to refer to.

I am hoping that I get into the habit of writing down reasonably detailed notes
of what we discuss - they are supposed to be more "lower-level" than the notes
Ed is keeping in gh-pages of this repo, but thats not going to be a hard and fast
rule.

In short, central place for notes and specs that reflects ongoing developer discussions.

Philosophy::

    Excuse me. Maybe your specs are out of date and don't reflect 
    the product. My specs are updated frequently. 
    The updating continues as the product is developed and new decisions 
    are made. 
 
    The spec always reflects our best collective understanding of how 
    the product is going to work.
